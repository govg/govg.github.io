I completed my thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Purushottam Kar](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/index.php) and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org). You can find my thesis 
manuscript [here](thesis.pdf), please note this is a personal copy. In addition, this work 
eventually resulted in a publication at AISTATS '19, the link for which is [here](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/mukhoty19a/mukhoty19a.pdf).
