            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Govind.</p>
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies in 2015, graduating with a BTech from IIT Kanpur, majoring in Aerospace Engineering. During my brief stay for the duration of my BTP, I was affiliated with the <a href="http://spectral.iitk.ac.in/hpcl/">Spectral Lab</a> where I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~tksen/">Prof. T.K. Sengupta</a>. I worked on porting codes used for CFD simulations to CUDA based implementations, and analyzing performance gains.</p>
<p>I worked with the Imaging and Computer Vision team at Siemens Research, Bangalore in the summer of 2014, as well as from May 2015 to April 2016. I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~kale/">Dr. Amit Kale</a>, on work ranging from implementing an internal machine learning library, an internal organ detection framework, and proposing a variant of a popular graph deformation based vertebral segmentation method in CT images. My mentors there included <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parmeet-bhatia-616b0923">Parmeet Bhatia</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/udaykurkure/">Dr. Uday Kurkure</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prabhuteja12/">Prabhu Teja</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing an MTech degree, from the department of CSE, IIT Kanpur. My interests lie in Machine Learning and Optimization, and hopefully my thesis will reflect the same. I expect to graduate by Summer 2017.</p>
