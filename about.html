            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Govind.</p>
<p>tl;dr - <a href="resume.pdf">Resume</a></p>
<p>I am currently a Vice President at Goldman Sachs, working as a Strategist with the
Private Credit group within Asset Management Division. I’m based in New York, helping
scale Asset Backed Finance and Investment Grade Private Credit. In my spare time you
can find me losing at board games to my friends or suffering through a quiz conducted
by <a href="https://kqaquizzes.org">KQA</a>.</p>
<p>I completed my MS in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2023,
where I focused on robustness in regression and classification, and high dimensional
probability. I initially enrolled in the PhD program but left after completing the
research rotation and coursework.</p>
<p>Before grad school, I worked at Goldman Sachs in Bangalore from 2018 to 2021, first as
an Analyst and then as an Associate with the Alternative Investments group in the
Investment Management Division.</p>
<p>I completed my M.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur in 2018, where I ranked first
in the program with a 10.0 GPA. My thesis was on robust algorithms for regression,
published at AISTATS 2019. You can read more about it on my <a href="acads.html">Academics</a> page.</p>
<p>Before that, I worked with the Imaging and Computer Vision team at Siemens Research,
Bangalore as both a summer intern (in ’14) and a full-time employee from May ’15 to
April ’16. I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~kale/">Dr. Amit Kale</a>,
on work ranging from implementing an internal machine learning library, an internal organ
detection framework, and proposing a variant of a popular graph deformation based vertebral
segmentation method in CT images. My mentors there included

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prabhuteja12/">Prabhu Teja</a>.</p>
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies in 2015, graduating with a BTech from IIT Kanpur,
majoring in Aerospace Engineering. During my brief stay for the duration of my BTP, I
was affiliated with the <a href="http://spectral.iitk.ac.in/hpcl/">Spectral Lab</a> where I worked
under the supervision of <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~tksen/">Prof. T.K. Sengupta</a>. I worked
on porting codes used for CFD simulations to CUDA based implementations, and analyzing
performance gains.</p>
