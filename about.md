Hi, I'm Govind.

I completed my undergraduate studies in 2015, graduating with a BTech from IIT 
Kanpur, majoring in Aerospace Engineering. During my brief stay for the 
duration of my BTP, I was affiliated with the 
[Spectral Lab](http://spectral.iitk.ac.in/hpcl/) where I worked under the 
supervision of [Prof. T.K. Sengupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~tksen/). I worked on
porting codes used for CFD simulations to CUDA based implementations, and analyzing
performance gains. 

I worked with the Imaging and Computer Vision team at Siemens Research, Bangalore
in the summer of 2014, as well as from May 2015 to April 2016. I worked under the
supervision of [Dr. Amit Kale](http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~kale/), on work ranging
from implementing an internal machine learning library, an internal organ detection
framework, and proposing a variant of a popular graph deformation based vertebral 
segmentation method in CT images. My mentors there included
[Parmeet Bhatia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parmeet-bhatia-616b0923),
[Dr. Uday Kurkure](https://sites.google.com/site/udaykurkure/) and 
[Prabhu Teja](https://sites.google.com/site/prabhuteja12/). 

I am currently pursuing an MTech degree, from the department of CSE, IIT Kanpur. 
My interests lie in Machine Learning and Optimization, and hopefully my thesis will
reflect the same. I expect to graduate by Summer 2017.
